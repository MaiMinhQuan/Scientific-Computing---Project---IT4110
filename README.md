# Description

CPU (Central Processing Unit), also known as central processor, is the brain of the computer.

In fact, computer CPUs are often designed in a square shape and made from semiconductors. The CPU when operating will generate heat due to the processing of instructions. CPU heat transfer is an important process to keep the CPU running smoothly and avoid overheating. The heat transfer process of the CPU takes place as follows:
 - Heat generation: When the CPU operates, the transistors inside it switch between states
turns on and off, generating heat.
 - Heat transfer through heatsink:
   - Heatsinks are usually made from metal such as aluminum or copper and are mounted directly
onto the surface of the CPU.
   - Heat from the CPU is transmitted through the contact surface and then spreads to the entire heatsink.

The following algorithm will describe the heat transfer process of the CPU.
